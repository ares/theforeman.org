### Upgrade warnings

Parameter permissions were unified under the Parameter resource type, all filters for CommonParameter (Global Parameters in the menu) are automatically migrated to new permission names. If user was granted one of view_params, edit_params, destroy_params, create_params, they now apply to Global Parameters too. Common Parameter permissions view_globals, edit_globals, create_globals, destroy_globals were removed. The same functionality can be achieved by specifying filter condition like `type = CommonParameter`. For more information, see ([#16739](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16739))
